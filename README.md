# notesProject

Application takes input string from user, then creates (in memory) and saves (to file) a list of notes;
also allows each note to render as a button that hides itself when pressed (note (text) remains in file);
also, at application launch, reads file notes, assigning each's text content to a unique and rendered note object

Application uses tkinter (user interface) and object-oriented programming (code structure)
