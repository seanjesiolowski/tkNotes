# notesProject
- project organized by classes-and-object(s) as well as modules-and-functions
- code written using Python and Python's tkinter (user interface library)

## Current application
- at launch, reads file notes-text
- takes input "note" string from user
- creates (in memory) and saves (to file) a list of notes
- allows each note to render as a button that hides itself when hide button pressed
- assigning each note's text content to a unique and subsequently-rendered note object
- allows user to edit/update the rendered note by inputting text in main entry and pressing note's edit button
- via user clicking on note button, can render each individual note via a new, focused, top-level window 
- includes the option to delete the individual note within new window

### Todo
- *big picture: complete C.R.U.D. functionality  (check!) and adequate styling/UI (not yet)*
- switch ui geometry management from pack to grid
